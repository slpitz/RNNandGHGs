# RNNs and GHGs
Testing RNNs on Greenhouse Gas time series data

## Motivation:

[NOAA](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/) has long term datasets of greenhouse gases from around the [world](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/dv/data/).

This Colab notebook was set up to grab the data from the NOAA website and use RNNs to predict the next few time steps.
